First Lesson: Obey The Testing Goat

Recently, I started working through the Test Driven Development with Python book by Harry Percival. After the first couple of chapters, I'm enjoying the approach of writing your tests and then writing the code to pass the test. 

So far we have written two kinds of tests, Functional Tests and  Unit Tests. Functional Tests are tests from the user's point of view while Unit Tests are tests from the programmer's point of view. 

For instance, in a basic web application your functional tests could be testing if the url address takes you to the correct page. The unit tests would then test the logic of how your code is implemented. 

I like the quick, iterative approach with the unit-test/code cycle that the book follows:
	1) Run the unit tests in the terminal
	2) Make a minimal code change in the editor
	3) Repeat


Although the testing feels a bit tedious to start, I can see why it will be useful as the application grows and I'm excited to keep trying it.
