Singleton

I was building a Criminal Intent app as part of the Android Big Nerd Ranch Guide and needed to use a singleton. I had seen the term used before but wasn't exactly sure what it meant or how a singleton is used.

A singleton is used so that there can only be one instance of a class. The advantage of using a singleton is that all the data in the singleton class will be available until the application is removed from memory. 

Using a singleton class allows the data to be easily passed between Controller classes.
